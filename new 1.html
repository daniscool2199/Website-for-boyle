      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Quantum computing is no longer science fiction—it’s becoming reality. Unlike classical computers that use bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in multiple states at once. This allows them to solve highly complex problems that are practically unsolvable with current supercomputers.</p>
      <p>Microsoft’s Majorana 1 chip, launched in 2025, marks a revolutionary milestone. By using topological qubits, it brings unprecedented error-resistance and scalability, setting the stage for a future shaped by quantum breakthroughs.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="issue">
      <h2>Defining the Issue: Underfunded Innovation</h2>
      <p>The U.S. National Quantum Initiative Act of 2018 was a critical step in laying the groundwork for quantum advancement. However, quantum development remains vastly underfunded and decentralized. Fragmented support across agencies leads to missed opportunities for large-scale growth and global competitiveness.</p>
      <p>According to the ITIF, the lack of a coordinated strategy delays commercialization and deployment of cutting-edge quantum hardware like Majorana 1.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="tech">
      <h2>Microsoft’s Majorana 1: A Technological Breakthrough</h2>
      <p>Majorana 1 is the first chip to utilize topological qubits, which are much more resilient to noise than traditional qubits. These qubits leverage Majorana zero modes, allowing quantum information to be encoded in a way that naturally resists local disturbances—eliminating the need for excessive error correction.</p>
      <p>With this architecture, Microsoft aims to tackle challenges such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Modeling quantum chemistry for next-generation drug development</li>
        <li>Accelerating artificial intelligence learning algorithms</li>
        <li>Enabling post-quantum cryptography for secure digital systems</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="global">
      <h2>The Global Quantum Landscape</h2>
      <p>While the U.S. debates policy, countries like China and Germany are investing billions into national quantum strategies. China’s centralized funding model and infrastructure investments have already propelled its quantum networks ahead of the West in several areas.</p>
      <p>Germany and Canada are prioritizing workforce development, cybersecurity, and international quantum alliances. Without similar commitment, the U.S. risks falling behind in what many are calling the next technological arms race.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="policy">
      <h2>Policy Recommendations</h2>
      <p>To ensure the U.S. remains a leader in quantum, we propose the following policy measures:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Double federal funding for the National Quantum Initiative over the next five years</li>
        <li>Establish Quantum Innovation Zones with tax incentives for private R&D</li>
        <li>Create a centralized Quantum Innovation Office to oversee nationwide strategy</li>
        <li>Encourage open data collaboration and set ethical standards for quantum use</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="benefits">
      <h2>The Benefits of Quantum Computing</h2>
      <p>Quantum computing can transform nearly every industry. Some of the most promising applications include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Precision modeling of complex biological systems and custom drug simulations</li>
        <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Quantum algorithms for optimizing portfolios and predicting market trends</li>
        <li><strong>Climate Science:</strong> Simulating atmospheric chemistry for more accurate climate predictions</li>
        <li><strong>Logistics:</strong> Route optimization and real-time traffic analysis for global shipping networks</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="education">
      <h2>Education & Workforce Development</h2>
      <p>Quantum literacy is critical. We propose a national campaign to integrate quantum computing into school curriculums, sponsor university research, and support minority inclusion in quantum fields. This includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Quantum certifications at community colleges</li>
        <li>University fellowships and quantum bootcamps</li>
        <li>Public-private internship pipelines</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="action">
      <h2>Call to Action</h2>
      <p>We urge Congress, educational institutions, and private sector leaders to take action by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Increasing funding for quantum infrastructure and research</li>
        <li>Forming task forces to align quantum development strategies</li>
        <li>Educating the public through multimedia and outreach programs</li>
        <li>Fostering international collaboration with quantum allies</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The quantum revolution is not a possibility—it is underway. With innovations like Microsoft’s Majorana 1, we stand at the frontier of a new era. The U.S. must move boldly, funding breakthroughs and fostering an ecosystem where quantum technologies can flourish. Our economic prosperity, security, and scientific leadership depend on it.</p>
